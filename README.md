# presentation
I'm attending the third year of IT at the university of Trento. Actually i'm intrested on many branches of this sector, like web developing (front/back end), and the machine learning, in particular neural network.

Even now throughout the development of this website i'm trying to improve myself, and i will publish my future works on my github page.
